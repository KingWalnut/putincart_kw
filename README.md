# putincart_kw
*for vorp*

**This allows any cart to accept animals or peds, for some reason REDM doesn't like to collect the hashes of all vehicles in a list so I decided to do it this way for now, its not the best but its better than only being able to use 3 carts in which most animals can just fall out.**

#
**HOW TO INSTALL:**

---------------------------

STEP 1) add ensure putincart_kw into your server.cfg

STEP 2) add putincart_kw to resources folder

*If you need help, join my discord, I run a RedM server that is in development and can provide support as well and future releases.*
