## putincart_kw
*for vorp*
**This allows any cart to accept animals or peds, for some reason REDM doesn't like to collect the hashes of all vehicles in a list so I decided to do it this way for now, its not the best but its better than only being able to use 3 carts in which most animals can just fall out.**

#
**HOW TO INSTALL:**

---------------------------

STEP 1) add ensure putincart_kw into your server.cfg


*If you need help, join my discord, I run a RedM server that is in development and can provide support as well and future releases.*

# KNOWN ISSUES:

When trying to stow a ped or animal, it is covered by the cart prompt, to avoid this move your character a bit and quickly press R to stow.
